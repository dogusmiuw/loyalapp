## Problems
Lack of digital infrastructure of local businesses, coffee shops.
The lack of a verifiable, trackable and sustainable system for the participants of the organizers at online or offline events.
Failure of companies to communicate their professional social responsibility projects to large masses.

So, how can these problems be solved?

## Solutions

Through secure, trackable, and interactive web3-based social responsibility projects that maximize impact.
Users will earn NFT badges at the end of the event and will be able to donate to social responsibility projects through our application.
